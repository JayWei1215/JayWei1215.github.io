# About Me

<img src="https://yizhao111.github.io/chenyizhao.jpg" class="floatpic" width="360" height="480">

Here is **Yizhao Chen(Steven, 陈艺钊)**.

I am a fourth-year **bachelor’s** student at **Northeastern University**, majoring in **Software Engineering**. Besides a strong interest in coding, I’m also keen on mathematics.

Currently, I work as a research assistant in the NEUDM-Lab, advised by [Prof. Shi Fen](http://faculty.neu.edu.cn/cse/fengshi). I have worked as a remote research assistant at Carnegie Mellon University, advised by [Prof. David P. Woodruff](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dwoodruf/). I also spent a lovely summer research program with [Prof. Hien Tran](https://math.sciences.ncsu.edu/people/tran/)'s team at NC State University.

I currently have a focus on inverse rendering problems, especially on the part of the **Data-Centric AI** and **Conversational System**.

If you are interested in any aspect of me, I would love to chat and collaborate, please email me at _1zhoazhao1@gmail.com_.

## Research Interests

- Conversational AI
- Data-Centric AI
- Recommendation System
- Applied Machine Learning

My current research focuses on practical and data-related problems that artificial intelligence faces in real life. My interests are on the **Conversational AI**, **Recommendation System** and its applications in **Industrial IoT**. In a word, advanced technologies like ML and IoT positively influence the life of everybody. I am keen on mitigating data-related biases in AI models, addressing challenges related to data quality and data scarcity. I wish to devote my talent to this meaningful cause and bring well-being to society.
