<br>

**In this project, I:**

- Created an AI-powered software system for managing and tracking logistics and distribution operations;
- Integrated a T5 model-trained "Knowledge-Based Q&A System" into the Customer Service Center module, enabling the creation of an intelligent chatbot that operates while safeguarding company privacy;
- Enhanced interface call logs and implemented error information alerts based on these logs, addressing slow query performances and system timeouts due to database indexing errors and primary key modifications;
- Handled unique cases like resource ID bypassing and resolved customer deletion issues due to state modification logic, addressing domain access issues and database connection pool inefficiencies;
- Integrated Flink into Spring Boot using a thread pool in non-blocking operation for message stream processing, utilized Neo4j for managing recommendation data, and employed JSoup for web scraping

### [Simulated Banking System [Code]](https://github.com/Yizhao111/AI-freight-management-center)

Here is a banking simulation system enabling features for simulating banking transactions and batch task processing, functions included fund transfers, salary payments, withdrawals, deposits, and interest calculations.<br><br>
**In this project, I:**

- Integrated multithreading techniques with the Java Swing framework to handle ten thousand simulated users with around two hundred million records
- Used Socket-based network programming to create a client-server architecture and the Runnable interface and member functions to control thread pausing and resuming.
