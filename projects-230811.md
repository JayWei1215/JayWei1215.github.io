## [AI-freight-management-center](https://github.com/Yizhao111/AI-freight-management-center)

This is an AI-powered software system for managing and tracking logistics and distribution operations. I am responsible for designing and implementing the Customer Service Center module.<br><br>
**In this project, I:**
- Collaborated with the development team to create an AI-powered software system for managing and tracking logistics and distribution operations, responsible for designing and implementing the Customer Service Center module 
- Innovatively integrated a "Knowledge-Based Q&A System" into the Customer Service Center module trained by NLP, enabling the creation of an intelligent chatbot that operates while safeguarding company privacy
- Employed Vue3 and Bootstrap component library with Streamlit to design user-friendly interfaces that enhanced user experience, meanwhile establishing a robust proxy between frontend and backend using Nginx to improve system stability and responsiveness
- Integrated Flink into Spring Boot using a thread pool for non-blocking operation and used it for processing message stream data, Neo4j for recommendation data, and JSoup for web scraping.

## [A Simulated Banking System ](https://github.com/Yizhao111/AI-freight-management-center)

Here is a banking simulation system enabling features for simulating banking transactions and batch task processing, functions included fund transfers, salary payments, withdrawals, deposits, and interest calculations.<br><br>
**In this project, I:**
- Integrated multithreading techniques with the Java Swing framework to handle ten thousand simulated users with around two hundred million records
- Used Socket-based network programming to create a client-server architecture and the Runnable interface and member functions to control thread pausing and resuming.
